In the dynamic landscape of the film industry, the exploration of how explicit socio-political content in movies compares to those emphasizing entertainment or aesthetics has become an increasingly pertinent area of inquiry. In this part, we want to unravel the nuanced interplay between critical reception and recognition in movies, aiming to discern whether movies addressing socio-political themes resonate differently with audiences compared to those designed that are non socio-political.

The research question at the core of this investigation is: "How does the critical reception and recognition of movies with explicit socio-political content compare to those focused on entertainment or aesthetics?" To answer this question, a comprehensive analysis was undertaken, considering a range of factors, from average ratings to standard deviations, with the ultimate goal of uncovering patterns and trends that illuminate the distinct nature of these two categories.
