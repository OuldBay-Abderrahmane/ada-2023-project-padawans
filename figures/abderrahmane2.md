##### Overall Sentiment
- For all combination we deep that films with plot summaries that have a negative overall sentiment tend to perform better on all metrics.

##### Average Ratings
- Considering the average ratings and the p-value matrix together, one could infer that movies that most frequently evoke 'joy' and 'love' are not only rated higher but also tend to have a statistically significant co-occurrence with 'surprise'. This pattern might suggest a successful emotional formula in movies.
- The statistical significance indicated by the p-value matrix adds depth to the interpretation of the average ratings, as it implies that the relationship between these emotions in movies is not just a matter of chance but may be a consistent pattern.
It's also worth noting that while 'anger' and 'sadness' are associated with slightly lower average ratings, they show a significant association with each other, which could reflect common thematic elements or genres within the dataset that handle more complex or challenging emotional content.

##### Box Office 
- By interpreting the bar chart in conjunction with the p-value matrix, we can deduce that films evoking 'fear' not only tend to generate high box office revenue but also have a statistically significant association with 'joy', which may point to successful movies in genres like action or adventure where both elements are present.
- The low box office revenue for movies with 'love' as the most frequent emotion, coupled with significant p-values when paired with other emotions like 'surprise', may suggest that while 'love' may not be the leading emotion for high revenue on its own, its combination with 'surprise' can contribute to a movie's financial success.
The analysis points to a nuanced relationship between the emotional content of films and their commercial performance, highlighting the potential for certain emotional combinations to drive box office success.

##### Popularity
- The combination of the bar chart and the p-value matrix suggests that movies evoking 'fear' tend to be popular and often co-occur with 'anger' and 'joy' in a way that is statistically significant. This could indicate that films that successfully blend these emotions resonate well with audiences and achieve popularity.
- The lower popularity for movies predominantly featuring 'love' and 'surprise' could suggest that these emotions, while important for narrative depth, might not be the leading drivers of popularity on their own.
The analysis could be beneficial for movie producers and marketers to understand which emotional content resonates with audiences and could potentially drive popularity.
