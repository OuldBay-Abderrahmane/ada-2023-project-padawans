Heatmaps Detailed Analysis:

- The combined data indicates a complex interplay between the historical subject of the film and its emotional impact. For instance, 'anger' and 'fear' in Vietnam-themed films correlate with higher ratings, possibly due to the raw and authentic portrayal of the conflict resonating with critics and history enthusiasts.
- On the commercial front, the success of World War 2 films could be linked to the portrayal of 'sadness' and 'surprise', possibly because these emotions align well with audience expectations for this genre, which often includes heroic and dramatic elements.

- The lack of significant p-values in certain areas suggests that some emotional associations may not be as influential across all metrics or themes. For instance, the consistent portrayal of 'anger' in Iraq War films might not guarantee box office success, underscoring the importance of other factors like contemporary political views or audience fatigue with war narratives.
In summary, these insights reflect how filmmakers leverage historical and emotional content to engage audiences. They also highlight the potential for these emotional cues to be strategically used in future film production and marketing to align with audience expectations and historical context.
