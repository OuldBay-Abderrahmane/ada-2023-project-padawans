What genres are hiding behind these films? Well, here is a line plot of the the evolution of the 10 most popular genres in the movie industry (in absolute number). We can clearly see the domination of the dramatic genre, becoming the leader since the 1940s, just after the beginning of the slow decline of black and white movies (the first color camera was invented by Kalmus in 1932!) and also after squashing the indie movies (Hollywod golden age and monopoyl). We can also observe that comedy films follow the same trend as for drama ones, but with a lower magnitude.
