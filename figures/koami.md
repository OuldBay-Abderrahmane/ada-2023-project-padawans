The statistical analysis provides strong evidence to conclude that movies with explicit socio-political content are received differently in terms of ratings when compared to movies focused on entertainment or aesthetics (non socio-political content). On average, movies with socio-political content tend to have slightly higher ratings than those in the entertainment/aesthetics category, and this difference is statistically significant. Additionally, the smaller standard deviation for Socio-Political movies suggests that they may also have more consistent ratings compared to Entertainment/Aesthetics movies.
