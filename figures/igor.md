Analysis:

Across decades the most prevailing socio-political themes depicted in movies among those that we defined in the table, are the economic hardship, struggle for survival, the war, the cold war and the space race. This is perfectly expectable as the 20 th century was characterised by several wars and confrontation at worldwide scale between large group of countries that were in concurrence for hegemon. These events had a hard impact on economics and survival conditions of peoples which explain the prevalence of this theme in films.

After this four comes the theme of civil right racial segregation followed by communism, revolution and apartheid. This is also expected as the 20 century was characterised by important movement for civil rights and against racial and sexual segregation and inequalities. Communist revolution in Russian, then in China  was also a characteristic mark of the 20 th century.

At the end come the theme of women rights, decolonization and soviet union dissolution.

We can see a clear influence of keys political events and cultural shifts on the frequencies of socio-political themes of interest depicted in movies.

The war theme undergo a large increase during World War I, then decrease after it end and during inter war period. We see a second increase at the moment of the great depression and reaching of a second pick during World War II and then beginning of the Cold War. The tendency to decrease is seen after the end of the Cold War.

The Space Race theme undergo an increase of frequency during World war I and II when the space race occurs between the European countries for the first, then the space race between allies and axes during Wold War II. But a very important increase can be only observed a few time after the beginning of the cold war during which a very important space race occurred between countries of eastern and western block. We observe a drop of the frequency of this them at the end of the cold war and soviet union dissolution which match to what is expected. A similar profile is observed for the cold war theme, we have a first small increase during World War I and II, then a second very important increase during the Cold War and a decrease when the time comes to itâ€™s end.

The theme of economic hardship start to increase during the world war I and stay at very high level during the whole 20 th century as the key political event had a very important impact on global economic and survival condition of people all around the world.

The theme of communism and revolution known a first increase after the October revolution in Russia and a second increase with the beginning of the Vietnam War and China revolution.

The theme of civil right and segregation that have at the beginning a very low frequency in film, undergo an increase at the moment of the beginning of civil right movements and women right movement. The frequency start then to decrease after the end of women right movement.

The theme of apartheid increased first during World War I, then undergo a second increase during World War II and reach a pic during civil right movement event and remain constant until the end of apartheid event after which it's frequency start to decrease slowly.

However some themes as Berlin Wall, Soviet Union dissolution looks like to be not influenced by key political events as their frequency is not low even before the occurrence of these historical events.

Other them also  women rights and decolonisation seems to be not linked to historical events as they frequency is always low and without important modification over time compared to other themes.
