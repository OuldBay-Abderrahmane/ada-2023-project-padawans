The contrast between enemies and allies representation is very clear for WWI, WWII, the Vietnam War and the War in Afghanistan and Iraq. This difference interest could be retraced to human psychology, where we respond more strongly to negative stimuli, associated with enemies, than positive stimuli, associated with allies. 
To nuance this, we have to note that since these wars happened in foreign soil for the US, and Historical War movies contribute a lot to the statistics, there is bound te have more foreign representation, independently of human preferences. The case of the Cold War where no actual battle was fought,shows this with a lesser difference in representation shift.


Not all the increase in representation happened with the same delay to the start of a war, lets look at this closer.
