- [1] Looking at some major actors of WWII, the prevalence of german representation can be seen a feen years after its begining as well but fades out rapidly, the same can be observed at a lower extent for the japanese representation. It also seems that big events trigger an increase in representation even after the main spike is going down. German and Japanese representation was mostly inexitent before WWII compared to France for example, but became relatively well represented afterwards, up until a global jump in representation due to film abundance.

- [2] The cold war period seems to have a delayed increase in representation after 1960, which sustains itself through the conflict. While Russian representation keeps rising afterward, the comparison with a few east european countries suggest that this is not only due to the rise of total number of films. 

- [3] The Vietnam war display similar behavior to the cold war but we can observe a decrease in representation after some time, the War in Afghanistan seem to display an surge of interest as well. The data does not stop abruptly in the dataset, so the last years having few representations is mainly due to lack of data.

- [6] We choose to focus on historical event involving the USA because for the time period of our dataset, the USA were the main producers of movies. Indeed, it seems like big events for other countries do not create the same reaction spike, like this example.

Overall, we would like to dive deeper into the increase of representation after a big event as well as the first spike in popularity.
