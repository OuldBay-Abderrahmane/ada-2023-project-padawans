The visualizations for emotion and sentiment distribution over the decades indicate a steady pattern. The Chi-square tests did not reveal any significant differences, leading us to maintain the null hypothesis of a uniform distribution over time. This suggests that despite the changing landscapes of society and film technology, the emotional and sentiment composition in movies has remained remarkably stable from decade to decade. Whether a film is from the 1920s or the 2000s, filmmakers have consistently balanced the portrayal of emotions and sentiments to resonate with audiences in a similar manner.
