The previous line chart becomes easily convoluted, let's see what a barplot can teach to us. Again, we can make the same observations as before. However, it is now more easy to see that indie movies had a difficult time from the 1930s to the 1960s and also that World cinema had difficulties to survive in the cinematographic world in the begiining of the 20th century. This could be explained by the fact that Hollywood was monopolizing the market at this time, followed by other big studios. However, the technology evolved and the costs for shooting a movie dropped. Also the mentalities changed: Many countries encountered cultural movements that encouraged the production of indie films and founded film festivals which allowed the international reconnaissance of films produced by small studios. These facts, in addition to the globalization of cultural works, help us understand why indie movies and Wold cinema were able to see their movie share increase and consolidate since the 1950s.
We finally see that the 10 most popular genre see their share decrease slightlyl through the years (much steeper in the first half of the 20th century), which is a rejoicing indication that the movie world is diversifying.
