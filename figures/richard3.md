# The influence of wars on demographic group representation 

## Evolution of representation of different war's main actors 

>In order to differentiate a natural variance in representation from a change that could reflect a war event, we computed the z-score of every points on the curves, giving us an insight on how >unusual a point is, we will take a z score of 2 for a sigificant difference.
