Before diving into deep analyses, let's just take a moment to familarize with the dataset through basic visualisations.

First, we will have a look to the frequence of movie releases through the years. We can obviously observe that from the 1980s, the cinematographic industry is clearly ramping up its production, thanks to new technologies reducing production costs and also the growing appetite of the public. We can also observe some little production depressions just after the two World Wars (1920s and 1940s).
