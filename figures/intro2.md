In this project, we delve into the rich interplay between movies and the socio-political fabric of the twentieth century. We aim to uncover how movies have reflected, influenced, and sometimes even transformed the socio-political climate of their times. Our exploration begins with an analysis of socio-political themes, identifying and understanding the prevalent motifs in movies. We then examine the correlation between movies genres and major socio-political events, exploring how cinematic expressions respond to and influence historical contexts. The study also investigates the representation of diverse social and demographic groups in movies, reflecting the evolving societal narratives. Additionally, we assess public perception and emotional responses to socio-political themes in movies through sentiment analysis. Finally, we evaluate how audiences and critics have received films with socio-political themes, providing insight into their impact and reception.

Our journey will conclude with a synthesis of these findings, revealing the powerful role movies have played as both a reflector and an influencer of socio-political narratives. Join us as we unravel the stories behind the screen, uncovering the hidden dialogues between movies and society.
